Eleven variations of Bug algorithm have been implemented and compared against each other on the EyeSim simulation platform. This paper discusses their relative performance for a number of different environment types as well as practical implementation issues.",

	Abstract = {The probabilistic roadmap approach is one of the leading motion planning techniques. Over the past eight years the technique has been studied by many different researchers. This has led to a large number of variants of the approach, each with its own merits. It is difficult to compare the different techniques because they were tested on different types of scenes, using different underlying libraries, implemented by different people on different machines. In this paper we provide a comparative study of a number of these techniques, all implemented in a single system and run on the same test scenes and on the same computer. In particular we compare collision checking techniques, basic sampling techniques, and node adding techniques. The results should help future users of the probabilistic roadmap planning approach to choose the correct techniques.},

# ![Path-Planner](resources/path_planner.png?raw=true "Path Planner")

Path planner is a webapp aimed for visually compare different path planning algorithms for intelligent agents.

## Available algorithms

- Cellular Decomposition *
- Visibility Graph
- Probabilistic Roadmap
- Simple Potential Field
- Potential Field with Memory
- Bug v1
- Bug v2
- Tangent Bug

\* **Note**: the planner assumes the world as a discrete grid, thus some algorithms may behave or may be implemented a little differently compared to specification, _e.g._ __Cellular Decomposition__.
